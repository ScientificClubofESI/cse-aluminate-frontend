## Points discussed in the last meeting:
1. 🚫 **Please avoid pushing directly to the main branch; instead, push to your respective branch and submit a pull request for review to avoid conflicts.**
2. **When creating a branch, name it using your name and the specific part you're working on.**
3. 🎉 **Congratulations! We've made significant progress, particularly with the landing page, and have successfully collaborated as a team using Git and GitHub.**
4. **The landing page is approximately 70% complete; it requires a section addition and minor modifications.**
5. **We've entered the section phase of our project. Here's what you need to do:**
   - Choose the part you'll be working on: All alumni cards have been assigned to Djinane, the filter to Amine, the contact section to Rania, and the pagination component, search with header modification component, and the alumni information section divided into two parts: alumni information and the second part containing the skills, programs, and services of the alumni.
   - Switch to the main branch using the command `git switch main`.
   - Execute `git pull` to retrieve the latest updates from the main branch.
   - Create a new branch for the section you've chosen, ensuring to name it accordingly. Switch to your branch and begin your work.
6. **Important Notes:**
   - Currently, our focus is on designing the components and their logic only. Linking between pages and backend implementation is not our priority at this stage. You may create small databases like arrays or JSON for component information.
   - Regarding routes, each folder within the "pages" folder represents a route. For example, to access the alumni section information, use the route `http://localhost:3000/allalumni/alumni`, which will render the alumni component.
   - Let's continue our collaborative efforts with motivation and gratitude. Thank you all for your hard work and dedication. Together, we can accomplish great things! 🌟 Let's keep up the momentum and support each other as we move forward with the project. 💪🏽👏🏼
